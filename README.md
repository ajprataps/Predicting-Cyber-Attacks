Predicting Cyber Attacks


Business Understanding
There are at least 2 million cyberattacks each day through different various forms of cyber threats. According to security firm Kaspersky Lab, cyberattacks are increasing every year. Cyber-attacks are an important issue faced by all organizations. Securing information systems is critical. Organizations should be able to understand the ecosystem and predict attacks. Predicting attacks quantitatively should be part of risk management. The cost impact due to worms, viruses, or other malicious software is significant. This project proposes an analytical model to predict the cyber-attack on systems (Destination IP) of an organization so they can avoid and try to implement the countermeasures.


Objective
We are preparing an analytical model to predict the cyber-attack (Generic) on set of end systems (Destination IP) of an organization.
